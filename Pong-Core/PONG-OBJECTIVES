PONG OBJECTIVES

There are three objects in total for PONG
    Left Paddle
    Right Paddle
    Pong ball

Rules for L&R Paddles
    Can only move up and down within the bounds of the screen (limited by CHECKS_WIDE and -CHECKS_WIDE)
    Are 3 blocks tall

Rules for Pong ball
    One block
    Can move NE, NW, SE, SW
        This simplifies movement a lot, and while not accurate to true PONG, i'm not trying to do trigonometric calculations on something that probably isn't fast enough to run them

Rules for the game
    Pong ball starts in the middle and randomly moves NE, NW, SE, SW
    If the pong ball exits either -y or y the game resets
    If the ball hits a wall or paddle, it moves the opposite direction it was going (NE<->SW, NW<->SE)
